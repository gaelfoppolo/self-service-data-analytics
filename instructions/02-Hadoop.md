# Hadoop

## Pre-Requisites

- 01-AWS completed
- OpenSSH installed or any SSH client

## Installation

In order to work, **each node** in the cluster **must have **Java and Hadoop installed. First Java:

```shell
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```

Then Hadoop, download, uncompress and move it to `/usr/local/` folder.

```
wget http://apache.crihan.fr/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.8.2/hadoop-2.8.2.tar.gz
sudo tar xzf hadoop-2.8.2.tar.gz 
sudo mv hadoop-2.8.2 /usr/local/hadoop
sudo chown -R ubuntu /usr/local/hadoop/
```

*Note*: why `/usr/local/`? The `/usr/local` hierarchy is for use when installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated. It may be used for programs and data that are shareable among a group of hosts. This is perfect for Hadoop.					

##Global configuration

Now that Hadoop is installed, we need to configure the global environment variables. Perform the following on **each node**. Edit `~/.profile` and append the following at the end of it:

```
# Hadoop configuration
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
export PATH="PATH:JAVA_HOME/bin"
export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop
export PATH=PATH:HADOOP_HOME/bin
```

*Note:* change the JVM path according to yours.

Finally reload with: `. .profile `

## Hadoop cluster configuration

This section will cover the Hadoop cluster configuration. **Six main files** must be configured in order to specify to Hadoop various configuration. Here we are going to configure it to launch in a fully distributed mode (multi nodes cluster).

Each file is located in the `etc/hadoop` of the Hadoop install folder. For us the full path is : `/usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop`.

First modify `hadoop-env.sh`:

```
export JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME}
```

to

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
```

### **core-site.xml**

This file contains the configuration settings for Hadoop Core (eg I/O) that are common to HDFS and MapReduce. It also informs Hadoop daemon where NameNode (the master) runs in the cluster. So each node must have this file completed.

Replace these two lines with the next block, and complete the master's private IP with your own.

```xml
<configuration>
</configuration>
```

```xml
<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>fs.default.name</name>
        <value>hdfs://<master's_private_IP>:9000</value>
    </property>
    <property>
        <name>hadoop.tmp.dir</name>
        <value>/home/ubuntu/hadooptmp</value>
        <description>A base for other temporary directories.</description>
    </property>
</configuration>
```

Don't forget to create the `/home/ubuntu/hadooptmp`folder!

### hdfs-site.xml

This file contains the configuration settings for HDFS daemons: the NameNode and the DataNodes. We can specify default block replication and permission checking on HDFS.

The *replication* value determine the number of each HDFS block being duplicated and distributed across the nodes in the cluster. Here we have 3 data nodes and we want to replicate data on each (maximum resilient) so we specify a factor of replication of 3.

The *namenode* and *datanode* folders will be created on respectively the master node and the slaves nodes.

Replace these two lines with the next block.

```xml
<configuration>
</configuration>
```

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.replication</name>
    <value>3</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
    <value>/usr/local/hadoop/hdfs/namenode</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.data.dir</name>
    <value>/usr/local/hadoop/hdfs/datanode</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

### mapred-site.xml

This file contains the configuration settings for MapReduce daemons: the job tracker and the task-trackers.

Since MapReduce v2, YARN became the default resource management system. YARN takes care of the resource management tasks that were performed by the MapReduce in the earlier version. This allows the MapReduce engine to take care of its own task, which is processing data.

First rename `mapred-site.xml.template` to `mapred-site.xml`.

Replace these two lines with the next block, to specify YARN as the default resource management system.

```xml
<configuration>
</configuration>
```

```xml
<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>mapreduce.framework.name</name>
        <value>yarn</value>
    </property>
</configuration>
```

### yarn-site.xml

This file contains the configuration settings for YARN. Since we specify YARN as our default resource management system, we need to configure it.

The `yarn.nodemanager.aux-services` property tells NodeManagers that there will be an auxiliary service called `mapreduce.shuffle`that they need to implement. After we tell the NodeManagers to implement that service, we give it a class name as the means to implement that service. This particular configuration tells MapReduce how to do its shuffle. Because NodeManagers wonâ€™t shuffle data for a non-MapReduce job by default, we need to configure such a service for MapReduce. 

Finally, we specify the **private** IP address of the master node, which doesn't change when the instances are restarted, so we don't have to update these files each time we start the cluster.

Replace these two lines with the next block.

```xml
<configuration>
</configuration>
```

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
      <name>yarn.nodemanager.aux-services</name>
      <value>mapreduce_shuffle</value>
  </property>
  <property>
      <name>yarn.nodemanager.auxservices.mapreduce.shuffle.class</name>
      <value>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.ShuffleHandler</value>
  </property>
  <property>
      <name>yarn.resourcemanager.hostname</name>
      <value><master's_private_IP></value>
      <description>The hostname of the Ressource Manager.</description>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

You can now copy these four files to each nodes, with secured copy. 

```
scp hadoop-env.sh core-site.xml hdfs-site.xml mapred-site.xml yarn-site.xml datanode1:/home/ubuntu/
ssh datanode1
sudo mv hadoop-env.sh core-site.xml hdfs-site.xml mapred-site.xml yarn-site.xml /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/
```

Repeat with `datanode2` and `datanode3`.

### masters

This file defines on which machines run the NameNode in our multi-node cluster. This is also here where we add the secondary NameNode.

**On the master (NameNode) :** create the `masters` file and add the master's private IP in it.

**On the slaves (DataNode) :** create the `masters` file but lets it **empy**.

###slaves

This file defines on which machines run the DataNodes in our multi-node cluster.

**On the master (NameNode) :** create the `slaves` file and add the slaves's private IP in it, one per line, as a list.

**On the slaves (DataNode) :** create the `slaves` file and add the slave's private IP of the current slave node.

### Formating HDFS

After all that configuration, it is now time to test drive the cluster. First, we need to format the HDFS file system on the NameNode. For the HDFS NameNode to start, it needs to initialize the directory  where it will hold its data. The format process will use the value assigned to `dfs.namenode.name.dir` in `etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml` earlier. Formatting destroys everything in the directory and sets up a new file 
system.

```sh
/usr/local/hadoop/bin/hdfs namenode -format
```

**Do this only once!**

If everything is good, should end with `Exiting with status 0` and `Shutting down NameNode`.

### Starting the cluster

Once formatting is successful, the HDFS and YARN services must be started.

```sh
/usr/local/hadoop/sbin/start-dfs.sh 
/usr/local/hadoop/sbin/start-yarn.sh 
```

And to stop them:

```
/usr/local/hadoop/sbin/stop-yarn.sh 
/usr/local/hadoop/sbin/stop-dfs.sh
```

To test if everything is good, on each node use the command `jps`. On master node, you will see master's process and on data nodes, you will see data's process.
